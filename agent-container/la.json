If the device meets the minimum criteria specified in [Devices – Minimum Requirements](https://docs.acrelec.com/atp/atp-documentation/atp-devices-minimum-requirements/), then an ATP-Compliant Windows image is available. Ask your Project Manager for the proper image, and they will point you to the corresponding storage. ## Why do I need a specific Windows Image? A specific Windows image is needed to set up your device. The ATP Compliant Windows images are available at [Windows Images](https://docs.acrelec.com/atp/atp-documentation/atp-devices-minimum-requirements/). After imaging the device, it can be used in a plug and play manner. The device imaging is a one-time process, and all further updates are made through remote packages. ## Where can I find the proper Windows image for my device? See [Windows Images](https://docs.acrelec.com/atp/atp-documentation/atp-devices-minimum-requirements/). ## How do I login into the device Administration Panel? Once your device is imaged, you will be prompted to the ATP Administration Panel (or ATP Admin), which requires a key to log in. The key for logging into the ATP Administration Panel is calculated using the algorithm found in the Password to Enter Administration Mode section in [ATP Equipment Staging – Windows 10](https://docs.acrelec.com/atp/atp-documentation/atp-equipment-staging-windows-10/). If you need to access the Administration Panel later, tap the unlock sequence while facing the device. ## I'm in. Now what? Once you have logged in, you must set the internet connection on the device. ### For Wi-Fi: - Select Peripherals Setup. - Select Wireless. - Select your preferred network. - Insert the password. - Go to the Internet tab and check the Current internet access value.
